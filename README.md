Assessing the Impact of Sampling Period Choice and Quantization Levels on Sound Quality: A Study on Aliasing and Insufficient Quantization


The goal of this project is to see the effect of a bad choice of sampling period on the sound (aliasing), as well as an insufficient number of the quantization levels on the quality of the sound.
